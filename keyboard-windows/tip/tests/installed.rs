//! What an installed copy of the keyboard looks like to Windows, and that removing it leaves
//! nothing behind
//!
//! These are skipped unless asked for, since they are only true right after the installer has
//! run or has removed the keyboard again: the `keyboard-windows-build` workflow runs `present`
//! and then `gone`, each as a 64-bit and as a 32-bit program.
